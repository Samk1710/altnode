🔹 Build AI Agents with Ease
Our intuitive IDE lets you:
🔧 Choose from powerful AI modules.
📜 Write custom functions with built-in Python support.
📂 Document and refine your agent’s capabilities effortlessly.

🎨 Own & Monetize Your AI as an NFT
Once your agent is ready, mint it as an NFT on the Flow blockchain.
🛡️ Metadata is securely stored on IPFS, turning your AI into a decentralized, tradeable asset.

🤖 No Coding? No Problem.
Just describe three things:
1️⃣ What your agent should do.
2️⃣ How it should handle input.
3️⃣ What the expected output should be.

✨ AITnode’s AI-powered system will generate a fully functional agent based on your vision.
